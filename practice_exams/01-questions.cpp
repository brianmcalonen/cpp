Chapter 1 - Intro to Programming
Computers can do many different jobs because they can be programmed.
Internally, the CPU consists of the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and the control unit.
The two general categories of software are operating systems and application software.
Since computer’s can’t be programmed in natural human language, algorithms must be written in a programming language.
High-level languages are close to the level of humans in terms of readability.
A program’s ability to run on several different types of computer systems is called portability.
Words or names defined by the programmer are called programmer-defined symbols.
Punctuation characters or symbols mark the beginning or ending of programming statements.
A variable is a named storage location.
The three primary activities of a program are input, processing, and output.
Output is information a program sends to the outside world.
Main memory, or RAM, is volatile, which means its contents are erased when power is removed from the computer. Secondary memory, such as a disk, CD, or flash drive, does not lose its contents when power is removed from the computer.
RAM stands for Random Access Memory.
ALU stands for Arithmetic and Logic Unit.

Chapter 2 - Intro to C++
Every complete C++ statement ends with a semicolon.
Every C++ program must have a function named main.
A group of statements, such as the body of a function, must be enclosed in braces {}.
978.65 X 10^12 would be written in E notation as 9.7865E14.
A variable’s scope is the part of the program that has access to the variable.
The modulus operator computes the remainder of doing integer division.
Comments are notes of explanation that document lines or sections of a program.
Single line comment: //		Multi-line comment: /*   */
Programming style refers to the way a programmer uses identifiers, spaces, tabs, blank lines, and punctuation characters to visually arrange a program’s source code. These are some, but not all, of the elements of programming style.
int main() { return 0; }
